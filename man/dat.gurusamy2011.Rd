\details{
   This network meta-analysis compared the effectiveness of seven interventions for decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation (Gurusamy et al., 2011).

   Fourteen studies reported mortality at 60 days, in 1,002 patients. Forty-five deaths were reported across all studies (4.5\%). Six studies observed deaths in all treatment arms while three studies did not observe any deaths.

   This dataset was used in Efthimiou et al. (2019) to introduce the Mantel-Haenszel method for network meta-analysis.

   One of the treatments (solvent detergent plasma) was only included in one study with zero events in both treatment arms; this study was excluded from all network meta-analyses. In addition, no death was observed in the antithrombin III arm of the only study evaluating this treatment which was excluded from the Mantel-Haenszel network meta-analysis.
