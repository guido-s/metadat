\details{
   The dataset contains the data from the meta-analysis by Michael et al. (2013) of experiments on the persuasive power of a brain image. The meta-analysis analyzed an original study by McCabe and Castel (2008) as well as 10 replication attempts conducted by the authors of the meta-analysis.

   In each study, participants read an article about using brain imaging as a lie detector. The article either included a superfluous fMRI image of a brain (brain) or not (no_brain). After reading the article, all participants responded to the statement \dQuote{Do you agree or disagree with the conclusion that brain imaging can be used as a lie detector?} on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).

   The original study by McCabe and Castel (2008) reported a relatively large increase in agreement due to the presence of brain images. Meta-analysis of the original study with the 10 replications suggests, however, a small, possibly null effect: an estimated average raw mean difference of 0.07 points, 95\% CI [-0.00, 0.14], under a random-effects model.

   In some studies, the article included a passage critiquing the primary claims made in the article; this is coded in the \code{Included_Critique} column for analysis as a possible moderator. Note that Experiment 3 by McCabe and Castel (2008) was a 2x2 between subjects design: brain image presence was manipulated as well as the inclusion of a critique. The two different critique conditions are recorded as separate rows in this dataset. Analysis of this dataset with metafor yields the same results (given rounding) reported in the manuscript.

\examples{
### copy data into 'dat' and examine data
dat <- dat.michael2013
dat

\dontrun{
### load metafor package
library(metafor)

### Data prep
# yi and vi are already provided, but here's how you would use escalc() to obtain
# a raw-mean difference and its variance.
# Note the measure parameter is "MD" for 'raw mean difference'
dat <- metafor::escalc(
  measure = "MD",

  sd1i = Brain_s,
  sd2i = No_brain_s,

### meta-analysis using a random-effects model of the raw mean differences
res <- rma(yi, vi, data=dat)
print(res, digits=2)

### examine if Included_Critique is a potential moderator
res <- rma(yi, vi, mods = ~ Included_Critique, data=dat)
