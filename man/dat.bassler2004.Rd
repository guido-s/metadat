\details{
   Results from 10 trials reporting the physicians' judgement on the overall efficacy of Ketotifen for long-term control of asthma and wheeze in children. A prespecified subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the treatment effect is different in trials with adequate blinding compared to trials with inadequate / unclear blinding.

   This data set is used as an example in Schwarzer et al. (2015).

### Show full data set
dat.bassler2004

\dontrun{
### Load meta package
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("meta"))

### Use DerSimonian-Laird estimator (which was the default in meta in the year 2015).
### Furthermore, print meta-analysis results with two digits.
oldset <- settings.meta(method.tau = "DL", digits = 2)

### Calculate experimental and control event rates
with(dat.bassler2004, summary(Ee / Ne))
with(dat.bassler2004, summary(Ec / Nc))

### Conduct meta-analysis using the inverse variance method
mb3 <- metabin(Ee, Ne, Ec, Nc, method = "I",
               data = dat.bassler2004, studlab = study)
mb3

### Conduct subgroup analysis comparing trials with adequate blinding
### to trials with inadequate or unclear blinding
mb3s <- update(mb3, subgroup = blind, print.subgroup.name = FALSE)
mb3s

### Conduct subgroup analysis assuming common between-study variance in subgroups
mb3s.c <- update(mb3s, tau.common = TRUE)
mb3s.c

### Use previous settings
settings.meta(oldset)
